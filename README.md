                                                        ## Handwritten Digit Classification using MNIST dataset

Digit Recognition model built with Tensorflow and OpenCV in python to recognize digits. This model is trained over 60000 images of MNIST dataset and has accuracy of 98.3%

This Project has following stages:

1. Training MNSIT dataset to classify handwritten digits using Tensorflow using Multi layer perceptron.
2. Analysing the performance of three different models in Tensorboard and selecting the best model based on validation loss and validation accuracy.
2. Saving the trained model (weights and biases)
3. Loading Saved model.
